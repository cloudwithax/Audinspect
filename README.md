# Audinspect

An audio inspector. Made for quick viewing of audio files. Built with Electron + React and wavesurfer.js

**YOU MUST HAVE FFMPEG INSTALLED IN CASE SOME AUDIO FILES DON'T WORK.**

**I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ERRORS CAUSED BY NOT HAVING FFMPEG INSTALLED.**

## Features

- Scrollwheel scrubbing
- Waveform view
- Quick audio file viewing

## Who is this for?

This implies you already have FFmpeg installed.
